This mini project is about local storage 
How local storage of browser stores data and what data.

Somehow store the info  that a person has logged in.
Person should be logged in even after closing browser or laptop.

Solution:
1) make a login function
2) Access the values from inputs from login function
    console.log("email entered: ", my_email);
    console.log("password entered: ", my_pass); //this consoles the input by user
